I am the author and maintainer of the R package sharp, released on CRAN in June 2022.

I would like to split the R package sharp (version 1.1.0) into two packages: sharp (version 1.1.1) and fake (version 1.0.0). 

The R package fake is made of functions that are included in the R package sharp (version 1.1.0). 

After release of fake on CRAN (if possible), I will submit the update of sharp (version 1.1.1) that (i) does not include the functions in fake, and (ii) depends on fake.

I hope this is ok.

Many thanks.

## Description

> This R package can be used to generate artificial data conditionally
> on pre-specified (simulated or user-defined) relationships between the
> variables and/or observations. Each observation is drawn from a
> multivariate Normal distribution where the mean vector and covariance
> matrix reflect the desired relationships. Outputs can be used to
> evaluate the performances of variable selection, graphical modelling,
> or clustering approaches by comparing the true and estimated
> structures.

## Installation

The released version of the package can be installed from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("fake")
```

The development version can be installed from
[GitHub](https://github.com/):

``` r
remotes::install_github("barbarabodinier/fake")
```

## Main functions

### Linear model

``` r
library(fake)

set.seed(1)
simul <- SimulateRegression(n = 100, pk = 20)
head(simul$xdata)
head(simul$ydata)
```

### Logistic model

``` r
set.seed(1)
simul <- SimulateRegression(n = 100, pk = 20, family = "binomial")
head(simul$ydata)
```

### Structural causal model

``` r
set.seed(1)
simul <- SimulateStructural(n = 100, pk = c(3, 2, 3))
head(simul$data)
```

### Gaussian graphical model

``` r
set.seed(1)
simul <- SimulateGraphical(n = 100, pk = 20)
head(simul$data)
```

### Gaussian mixture model

``` r
set.seed(1)
simul <- SimulateClustering(n = c(10, 10, 10), pk = 20)
head(simul$data)
```

## Extraction and visualisation of the results

The true model structure is returned in the output of any of the main
functions in:

``` r
simul$theta
```

The functions `print()`, `summary()` and `plot()` can be used on the
outputs from the main functions.

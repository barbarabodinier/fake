# fake: Flexible Data Simulation Using The Multivariate Normal Distribution

## Description

> Simulation of data from Gaussian Graphical Models (B Bodinier, S
> Filippi, TH Nost, J Chiquet, M Chadeau-Hyam (2021)
> \<arXiv:2106.02521\>). By controlling the conditional independence
> structure between the variables, these multivariate simulation tools
> can be used to evaluate the performance of regression, dimensionality
> reduction or graphical models.

## Installation

The development version can be installed from
[GitHub](https://github.com/):

``` r
devtools::install_github("barbarabodinier/fake")
```

## Use
